# Mental-health-prediction-using-Machine-learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the mental health status of individuals based on their responses to a survey. The model will utilize the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble method known for its accuracy and ability to handle various types of data.
